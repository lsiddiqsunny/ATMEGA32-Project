### project Idea (In short)
-----------------
An automated ticketing system for metrorail in Bangladesh.<br>
### Motivation
-----------------
In Bangladesh, people have to buy ticket queued in a long line. This is just waste of valuable time. Moreover, if you are in hurry, it may be brother you. This project will make the ticket buying system easier.<br>
### Project Idea (In brief)
-----------------

In this project, we are going to build a ticketing system for Metrorail in our country. Every traveler should have an <b>RFID card</b>. This unique id card will determine the balance and information of the owner. He/ She can refill the balance whenever they want (maybe via Bkash or Rocket). <br>

We maintain travelersâ€™ information in a database. Every Metrorail have a microcontroller-based <b>RFID based checking system</b>. When a traveler comes and shows his RFID card, it checks via <b>WIFI module</b> if he has balance or not. If there is enough balance, he can enter the train. If there is not enough balance, he cannot enter the train before refilling. We send massage via <b> SIM900A kit</b>.<br>
